This Pig script uses the Book-Crossing dataset (http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) to find the most popular book. The book with the highest number of explicit ratings is considered to be the most popular book.

This script was written for my own personal interest. I have been learning about the Hadoop ecosystem to help pursue a position in Data Science, Big Data, or a related field. I used a pseudo-distributed Hadoop cluster on a RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.2 virtual machine.

Comments, critiques, suggestions, etc. are welcome.
